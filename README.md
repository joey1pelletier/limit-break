 
# Limit Break

## Abstract

Created with React.js and Next.js, Limit Break is a web app that allows me (the main user) to conquer my big fears and anxieties via journaling, answering guiding questions/prompts that are based on what I've been asked during past therapy sessions, and conquering smaller fears/actions that build up to said big fear. The app will also keep track of all the fears I conquer and include additional resources that are either from the web or from what I learned in past therapy sessions. In the case of an emergency (panic attacks, unescapable thoughts of hopelessness, etc.), pressing an emergency button will guide me to mental resources, along with providing a document that includes any user input added to fears, actions, and question/prompt answers. That way, when handed to a medical professional, they can have a better idea on how to assist through the current situation.

## Winter Break Progress

### My Goals for Winter Break

Considering I did not work on this project over break, I did not have any goals to accomplish, other than just recovering from the previous semester.

### My Accomplishments and Reflection on Time Management

Again, I did not work on the project over break. Because of that, my time management will need to change from recovery mode to floor-it-get-things-done mode.

### Integration of Feedback

Other than applying RMPP panel feedback (required to pass RMPP) to my project concept, no other work has been done over break.

### Learned Lessons

Because I have not worked on the project over break, I learned that working over break would've made the capstone sequence less stressful and time-consuming. Therefore, I will need to prioritize more time towards working on my project this semester.

## Project Milestones

### 30% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline (January 28th) for the following items:

- Entire Figma UI mock-up of Limit Break will be completed, and ready to be user-tested and critiqued
- Sufficient knowledge and practice of React.js and Next.js will be gained, that way project development can start smoothly.
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04 will be the main learning resource.

### 50% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline for the following items:
- Feedback from user-testing and critique will be applied to the UI of Limit Break.
- Fear-conquering part of Limit Break (the part circled on the diagram photo below) will be fully developed with React.js (front-end UI) and Next.js (database of user info and input).

### 90% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline for the following items:
- All app components will be fully developed, and ready for final user-testing and critique.
- Final user-testing and critique will make room for bug fixes and final touches.

### 100% Project Complete Mark

This progress mark will be the deadline for the following items:
- Final bug fixes and touches are applied to the project, and will be ready for Expo.

## Week 1 Goals

These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
- Using feedback from the ATLS 4630 prototype of Limit Break, create a Figma mockup that shows the UI and functionality of the circled part of the diagram from the picture above. 
    -   Be sure to let users test out the process of doing the process above. Do they understand what the app is telling them to do? What are the difficulties that users will run into? Use feedback for re-iterations.
    -   At the very minimum, this can be done as a paper prototype.
- Keep following the React tutorial, and if possible, add the learned techniques to the overall project. Think of how this can be added to the project functionality.
- Start learning how to add databases with Next.js.

## Week 1 Progress

My goals for last week were the following:
- Using feedback from the ATLS 4630 prototype of Limit Break, create a Figma mockup that shows the UI and functionality of the circled part of the diagram from the picture above. 
    -   Be sure to let users test out the process of doing the process above. Do they understand what the app is telling them to do? What are the difficulties that users will run into? Use feedback for re-iterations.
    -   At the very minimum, this can be done as a paper prototype.
- Keep following the React tutorial, and if possible, add the learned techniques to the overall project. Think of how this can be added to the project functionality.
- Start learning how to add databases with Next.js.

I was able to accomplish the following:
- I came up with a new design for my app. I felt critical of my old design, looked at inspirations of other mobile app UIs, and implemented the design on Figma. So far, it is still a work-in-progress because my time management was finicky last week.
    -   No user-testing was done last week. Fortunately this week I have more opportunities (fencing meetings start, a lot of users for testing) to do that. The design just needs to be completed by the end of the 21st. Although I was able to reflect on the previous design and re-iterate.
- I followed a new react tutorial and learned the following new topics
    - Proper react directory structure (have a folder for components, pages, json files, assets, etc.)
    - Knowing the proper use of useEffect (if you want to re-render a component a fixed number of times)
    - Implementing APIs to React projects
    - Loading components when using API
    - The proper usage of dynamic rendering
    - I will plan to start implementing these concepts to my project this week.
- I learned that a Next.js intergration to my project will need an adjustment on how I use the React network routing tool.

I integrated feedback by doing a re-iteration of the app's design, after not feeling confident with my previous one. 

I learned that it will take more time to complete a full Figma prototype, so a lot of my time until the 28th will need to be focused on that.

## Week 2 Goals
- These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
    - Complete the entire UI in Figma. As you complete certain parts, perform user testing on those things. Avoid trying to be a perfectionist on this. When in doubt, just go straight into testing.
    - Continue practicing React. Get more confident with your skills.
        - As you build the static main menu and go further into development, you may run into skill issues that should be remedied via the React documentaion and tutorials (YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)
    -  Try completing a tutorial for Next.js.

## HX/UX Testing Round 1

Part 1

- Starting Deliverables 
    -   Design Mock-Up of Current Iteration of App Prototype
        - I want to be confident with which design I should stick with. Therefore, out of a couple design templates, I'll ask the user which one they like the most.
    -   High-Fidelity Digital Prototype
        - Before testing the entire UI, have users test out current prototype components/iterations.

- UX Testing Type with Stakeholders
    - In terms of design critique, reach out to faculty members and fellow CTD students and get their feedback.
    - With other college students as the stakeholders, perform a usability interview where they will test out the following (via High-Fidelity Figma Prototype):
        - Main Menu
            - Do they understand how the main menu works? Will it require an introductory tutorial?
        - Break Your Limits
            - Have users explain what they know as they go through this feature.
                - Do they understand each UI component? Do they understand how this feature is supposed to flow?
                - Document whenever a user is lost, and redirect/assist them.
        - Strengthen Your Knowledge
            -   Do users understand this app's feature? Have them explain what they know.
            - Do they feel that the resources may be of benefit to them in any way?
        - Track Your Journey
            - Do users understand this app's feature? Have them explain what they know.
        - Overall App flow
            - Can users navigate through the apps with minimal assistance? Note any edge cases that show up.
            - Make sure there are no points where the user gets stuck in the app.

Part 2
- I showed my current UI design to a fellow CTD student, which they felt they had no extra feedback to give, other than pointing out that the current UI looks a lot more better than the previous one.
- A user (college student; original demographic before audience changed) tested out the user experience. This involved me directing them through the app and seeing how they navigate the app with minimal assistance. As they went through the experience, I took notes of the following:
    - User was able to select the correct menu option for facing fears.
    - On the fear/step creation page, the user sticks with one step, and presses finish. 
    - User doesn't now what what to do when on the main fear facing page (Break Your Limits), and then proceeds to click on the tutorial button.
    - The tutorial explanation allowed the user to be guided through "Break Your Limits".
    - When on the confidence rating / prompt questions part of "Break Your Limits", the user didn't know how to go back to the page's main feature. They proceeded to press the hamburger menu to try and go back, and thought that "Track Your Journey" was the correct option to go back. 
        - User says they'll log off from the app, and hypothetically work on the steps he wrote down.    
- Overall, the app design seems to be  aethsetically pleasing, and is a step up from the previous iteration. In terms of the app experience, the terminology of the app's features seem to be confusing. There was also some confusion when trying to go back to a previous page. For the app concept, it looks like the amount of steps a user will add for a fear will vary.
- In terms of lessons learned, I learned that the 2nd iteration of the app's design was detrimental to my project's success. I also learned about the importance of back buttons, and how I shouldn't rely on the user knowing how to back-swipe or not (I am working on a web app after all, it's not only going to be on a mobile interface). Some bugs within the experience were demonstrated during the test, and should be fixed for efficient app flow.
    - The following feedback was applied:
        - Added back button to fear/step page
        - Add feature where user can add confidence rating to each fear/step during the fear creation page.
        - Change "track your journey" button to something more obvious. Along with other terminologies of app features.

    - Complete the entire UI in Figma. As you complete certain parts, perform user testing on those things. Avoid trying to be a perfectionist on this. When in doubt, just go straight into testing.
    - Continue practicing React. Get more confident with your skills.
        - As you build the static main menu and go further into development, you may run into skill issues that should be remedied via the React documentaion and tutorials (YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)
    -  Try completing a tutorial for Next.js.
- I was able to accomplish the following:
    - Although I still have a tiny bit of things to finish on the mock-up, I was able to perform some user-testing on the app experience and design. 
    - I did not practice on React nor Next.js, as I felt that the Figma prototype was a priority to work on first.
    - I had things outside of school to take care of, so I should plan on managing my time more wisely.
- The following feedback was integrated:
    - Added back button to fear/step page
    - Add feature where user can add confidence rating to each fear/step during the fear creation page.
    - Change "track your journey" button to something more obvious. Along with other terminologies of app features. 
- Nothing was unexpected, although I'm realizing that my time management could use some work.

## Week 3 Goals
- These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
    - Complete the entire UI in Figma. As you complete certain parts, perform user testing on those things. Avoid trying to be a perfectionist on this. When in doubt, just go straight into testing.
        -   You got away with skimping on that this week, but next week will be THE deadline because you will have to present this.
        - Of course, do more user-testing. You can never do too much of it.
            - Some users may run into problems that others wouldn't have.  
    - Continue practicing React. Get more confident with your skills.
        - As you build the static main menu and go further into development, you may run into skill issues that should be remedied via the React documentaion and tutorials (YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)
        - Again, you got away with skimping on this, but you need to show that you are confident with this for the presentation next week.
    - DO a Next.js tutorial.

## Week 3 Progress
- These are the goals that were to be completed by last week:
    - Complete the entire UI in Figma. As you complete certain parts, perform user testing on those things. Avoid trying to be a perfectionist on this. When in doubt, just go straight into testing.
        -   You got away with skimping on that this week, but next week will be THE deadline because you will have to present this.

        - Again, you got away with skimping on this, but you need to show that you are confident with this for the presentation next week.
    - DO a Next.js tutorial.

- I was able to accomplish the following:
    - The Figma UI prototype is fully completed and ready to use as reference for development in React.
        - Second round of user-testing will be done before capstone class on 2/4.
    - When it came to React, I was able to make progress on a static main menu screen, and I will continue to implement app components and pages. I used a previous React folder as a starting point and switched from the old design to the new one. It's not in this repo yet, so this is the current link: pelletier-capstone-practice.vercel.app
    - Essentially, the project is now at the 30% Project Complete Mark as described in the Project Milestones section.
- So far, nothing was unexpected. I feel like I did a better job at time management this time.

## Week 4 Goals

- These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
    -  Move onto React Development
        - Figure out how to transition from page to page
        - See how you can retain user input when moving throughout the app
        - All in all, progress should be made through the development of the "Conquer your Fears" feature of the app.
    - Think about reaching out to Peter (advisor) on if I should stick with React/Firebase or Next.js for attaching a database 
    - Do more user-testing of UI and continue to make adjustments

## Week 4 Progress
-  These were the goals that should've be completed by this week:
    -  Move onto React Development
        - Figure out how to transition from page to page
        - See how you can retain user input when moving throughout the app
        - All in all, progress should be made through the development of the "Conquer your Fears" feature of the app.
    - Think about reaching out to Peter (advisor) on if I should stick with React/Firebase or Next.js for attaching a database 
    - Do more user-testing of UI and continue to make adjustments
    - I was able to accomplish the following
        - The React page router was successfully implemented, and I'm able to connect the main menu page to the 'conquer my fears' page.
        - Right now, I am able to retrieve user input for fears/steps and the confidence rating via console logs. Next week, I will see about either setting up Firebase or stick with a local storage API as a starting point (then transition to Firebase).
        - I haven't set up a meeting with my adviser, but I could try sending him an email about my progress.
        - I planned on doing user-testing, but I wanted to really get started with development. 
    - I integrated the confidence rating feedback by making sure there's less choices (3 instead of 10). I was able to develop this with stylized radio buttons. I'll figure out a way to structure the onboarding process (user enters starting info, meds, etc.).
    - Although React is something I'm still new with, I'm proud of my progress so far, which I was honestly not expecting. I thought I'd still suck at it, so that's a relief.

## Week 5 Goals

- These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
    - Figure out how you will structure and store user input.
    - Before meeting with mentor, do some research on how to set up Firebase with React.
    - Make sure you get to a point where you implement stylized components from Firebase.

## Mentor Review

- Prior to the meeting with my mentor (Peter Rosenthal), I followed a React + Firebase tutorial that taught me how to do the following concepts:
    - Firebase setup and onboarding with React
    - Setting up Google Authentication
    - Creating a collection for objects to be stored into
    - Adding data to stylized components

- During our meeting, we came to the following conclusions:
    - There's no need to set up Next.js. Everything for this project can be done with just React and Firebase.
    - Like the tutorial, it should be fine to setup a Google Authentication for this project.
    - Make sure every part of user input is stored and secured into the database
    - It'll be easier to store user input as strings.
    - Because the fear and step setup is a bit complicated, you'll need to have separate objects for fears/steps.
    - I will need to find a way to structure the fears/steps, in a way that they all relate to each other, in Firebase. Will require some planning prior to coding.
    - As far as progress goes, Peter told me that I am on good track for completing my project on-time. All I have to do is think about the structure of the database, and figure out how to develop the app based on that. Otherwise, that would be the only complicated part of the project.

## Week 5 Progress

- These were the goals that should''ve been completed by this week:
    - Figure out how you will structure and store user input.
    - Before meeting with mentor, do some research on how to set up Firebase with React.
    - Make sure you get to a point where you implement stylized components from Firebase.

- I was able to accomplish the following
    - For structuring and storing user input, Peter gave me good advice on how to do that for my project. I would just need to have fears/steps as separate objects and figure out a way to make them relate to each other.
    - I did a React + Firebase tutorial that showed me how to setup Firebase with React, create/store collections of data, and setup Google Authentication.
    - In terms of stylized components from Firebase, this would be as simple as having stylized divs with retrieved data information inside of them.

- Although last week and this week halted my time on capstone work due to unforeseen life events, Peter says I'm still on good track to get this project done on time, and I feel better about doing the Firebase setup for my project.

## Week 6 Goals

- These are the goals that should be completed by next week:
    - Figure out how you will structure and store user input, knowing that you will need separate fear/step objects. 
    - Using my learnings from the React + Firebase tutorial, implement the Firebase setup to my project and make sure that user input is effectively stored into the database.
    - It would be best to have the full 'Conquer Your Fears' feature to be completed by this time. You already have guidance and knowledge to get to that point.
        - Be sure to contact Peter and/or peers if you have any troubles with this.

## Week 6 Progress

These were the goals that should’ve been completed by this week: 

Figure out how you will structure and store user input, knowing that you will need separate fear/step objects.
Using my learnings from the React + Firebase tutorial, implement the Firebase setup to my project and make sure that user input is effectively stored into the database.
It would be best to have the full 'Conquer Your Fears' feature to be completed by this time. You already have guidance and knowledge to get to that point.
Be sure to contact Peter and/or peers if you have any troubles with this.

I was able to accomplish the following:

I did a rough draft of the database structure.


Collection of Fear(s)
Rating (check if it's low, medium, or high)
Question 1 string data
Question 2 string data
question 3 string data
Subcollection of step(s)
Rating (check if it's low, medium, or high)
Question 1 string data
Question 2 string data
 Question 3 string data
IsComplete boolean
isComplete boolean
I am working on setting up Google authentication for my project.
I got Firebase set up for my project.

Because of my surgery last week, I was out of action from Tuesday to Friday. Therefore, I am fairly behind on this. Not sure if there would be extensions b/c this is still a 10 week project. If anything, I’ll bite the bullet and just do as much work as I can for the next 3-4 weeks.

I am also running into GitHub problems……..ugh.

Week 7 Goals

Here are the goals to complete by next week

Get that part (should’ve been done by milestone 2) done. 
Communicate with Peter and/or the other mentor that can possibly help you.
You work when you have down time.
Get github fixed. If not by Wednesday, talk to Anthony. He’s free on thursdays. 

## Week 7 Progress

These were the goals to complete by this week:
- Get the Milestone 2 part done.
- Communicate with Peter and/or the other mentor that can possibly help you.
- You work when you have down time.
- Get github fixed.
I was able to accomplish the following:
- I got fear and step data to be inputted and established into the database. Now I just need to figure out how to get a user to only see their data, rather than all the data in the database. Once that is finished, and I am able to let the user type in their prompt answers and clear completed steps and fears, the hardest parts of the project will be complete. The "Explore Resources" will pretty much just be static pages of text, and the "Fears Conquered" page will just sort through the user's fears and display which ones are complete. 
Overall, I ran into software roadblocks (as usual), but considering I don't have other things to catch up on for other classes, this week will be fully dedicated to capstone. I WILL have a working demo to show for the presentation next week.

Oh, and I got feedback from Aileen Pierce. I'll try to setup a meeting with her this week.

## Week 8 Goals

These are the goals to complete by next week:
- Develop "Conquer Your Fears", where you will have a working demo for Expert Presentations next week.
    - If you are able to get a Zoom meeting with Alieen, work with her for feedback/advice/roadblocks.  
- Get started on developing the other pages.
    - "Explore Resources" should be an easy page to develop. It will just be static pages.
    - "Fears Conquered" will check for any conquered fear for a user in the database.

## Week 8 Progress

These were the goals to complete by this week:

- Develop "Conquer Your Fears", where you will have a working demo for Expert Presentations next week.
    - If you are able to get a Zoom meeting with Alieen, work with her for feedback/advice/roadblocks.  
- Get started on developing the other pages.
    - "Explore Resources" should be an easy page to develop. It will just be static pages.
    - "Fears Conquered" will check for any conquered fear for a user in the database.

I was able to accomplish the following:
- I have a working demo to show what I have done so far.
- I worked with Aileen towards any additional UI changes and implementations of react code/components.

I integrated feedback by applying what Aileen was talking about in regards of react components, and applied it to the real-time update (React and Firebase) of user input. I will keep her other feedback in mind for when I finish the project.

Developing the real-time update of user input inside of React and Firebase was a challenge, but that specific challenge is the biggest, longest, and most essential part of this project. With that out of the way, I feel better about completing this project on-time.

## Expert Review Feedback

The experts reviewing my presentation gave me the following advice:

- Rishi: great that it works; how long ago was this and have you been able to use it yet yourself? (this suggests that you should start using it ASAP).

- Krithik: what were the user tests for?

- Suibi: fear is something very private -- so how do you imagine getting others to engage with your project?

Here are my thoughts on the advice:
- I will be sure to complete the feature that allows a user to complete fears once they feel they received a high confidence rating. Once that's done, then I can use the app to my own potential and use it when it comes to facing any fears/challenges.
- The user tests were for app flow and the design process. However, at this point, I would need to conduct tests for myself and see how benefitial it is for completing my personal goals (in this case, conquering fears/challenges).
- In terms of having others engage with my project, I could do some research on how I can make the data more secure through Firebase or other means. Could be a good stretch goal, but the main project should be priority to work on and finish. If time wasn't a huge constraint, then I'd be more than happy to figure that problem out.

## Week 9 Goals

Here are the goals that should be accomplished by next week:
- Add in the feature where the users can complete fears, and have them added to the "Fears Conquered" page. Also add the "Tutorial" part to "Conquer Your Fears"
- Perform more CSS adjustments to match the Figma prototype.
- Work on the navbar. Have the user be able to navigate to different parts of the app without relying on back-swiping.

## Week 9 Progress

Here are the goals that should've been accomplished by this week:
- Add in the feature where the users can complete fears, and have them added to the "Fears Conquered" page. Also add the "Tutorial" part to "Conquer Your Fears"
- Perform more CSS adjustments to match the Figma prototype.
- Work on the navbar. Have the user be able to navigate to different parts of the app without relying on back-swiping.

- Here's what I've done:
    - I added the feature where users can mark their fear/step as complete. I still need to do the Fears Conquered page but that should be similar to how I query the fear/steps on Conquer Your Fears. Just need to show fear/steps that are marked as 'complete' on the page. Hopefully shouldn't be a hard thing to do.
    - I thought of design decisions (particularly the complete fear/step part) and coded them, but still need to do CSS adjustments. 
    - I still need to work on the navbar, but it should just involve a useState that pops up a Navbar component. Again, shouldn't be a hard thing to do.

- A bunch of things and life stuff came up last week, so I didn't get as many things done. Even though the hardest part of the project (real-time UI and database update) is complete, I'll still need to sprint this out ASAP, and not depend on getting it done right after spring break. That way I can guarantee I have a finished project by then.
- Here's the following I still need to get done:
    - Add tutorial for FearPage.jsx
    - Adjust css for FearPage.jsx. Adjust color pallete.
    - Position the back-button in FearInfo and StepInfo.jsx
    - make fears show up on 'Fears Conquered' page
    - Make completed fear and its steps disappear from FearPage.jsx
    - Add hamburger menu navbar (create as jsx component)
    - Add static pages for 'Explore Resources'
    - Add info for emergency pop-up (scrapping pdf feature...it will now be a stretch goal)
        -   Lifeline and Helpline numbers
        -   Link to CU Boulder CAPS
        - Do additional research on what other apps have for an emergency feature
    - Make LogIn.jsx a well-designed page (no more ugly sign in button)
    - Position sign-out and display name better on Main Menu


- I also tested the app by working on a fear that I want to conquer. So far, although it's not a magical tool that'll conquer all my fears, it gave me better insight on how to conquer them. The journaling via answering the prompt questions allowed me to think about stuff more and cleared up anxieties in my head. I found out that working on multiple fears is beneficial, so I plan on adding that feature as well (the page I have for the fear setup already adds fears/steps to the database, just need to add a link to it). That feedback (from myself) will need to be implemented ASAP.
- I learned that I will need to optimize my time management for this project for the next 2 weeks. I should put in more than 12 hours a week, considering we are now in crunch time. I need to treat the uncompleted things as a strict checklist.

## Week 10 and Spring Break Goals

This is the link to my presentation for experts: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LznvlbEwxLnGUGrRGSiV5fDieIsKC4j39M7n4GBWUkw/edit?usp=sharing
- Any instructor feedback/advice on this presentation is welcome.

Here's the following I still need to get done before 100% completion:
- Add tutorial pop-up for FearPage.jsx
    -   Static pop-up that explains how to use the Conquer Your Fears feature
- Adjust css for FearPage.jsx (make it look like Figma prototype). Adjust color pallete.
- Position the back-button in FearInfo and StepInfo.jsx
- make fears show up on 'Fears Conquered' page
- Make completed fear and its steps disappear from FearPage.jsx
- Add hamburger menu navbar (create as jsx component)
- Add static pages for 'Explore Resources'
- Add info for emergency pop-up (scrapping pdf feature...it will now be a stretch goal)
    -   Lifeline and Helpline numbers
    -   Link to CU Boulder CAPS
    - Do additional research on what other apps have for an emergency feature
- Make LogIn.jsx a well-designed page (no more ugly sign in button)
- Position sign-out and display name better on Main Menu
- Any bug fixes and feedback implementations during my experience with app.

- Right now, I feel like I am at 85% completion, considering that the "Conquer Your Fears" part of the app is the whole meat of my project. All the hard react/programming stuff is out of the way, but there are multiple things that will need to be adjusted and finished ASAP. 

- I will manage my time by spending 20+ hours per week on my project, along with making my weekends and spring break blocked off for that until capstone is done. At the latest, Everything from the checklist will need to be completed by March 31st. 

## Week 10 and Spring Break Progress

These were the final things I needed to get done for my project: 

- Add tutorial pop-up for FearPage.jsx
    -   Static pop-up that explains how to use the Conquer Your Fears feature
- Adjust css for FearPage.jsx (make it look like Figma prototype). Adjust color pallete.
- Position the back-button in FearInfo and StepInfo.jsx
- make fears show up on 'Fears Conquered' page
- Make completed fear and its steps disappear from FearPage.jsx
- Add hamburger menu navbar (create as jsx component)
- Add static pages for 'Explore Resources'
- Add info for emergency pop-up (scrapping pdf feature...it will now be a stretch goal)
    -   Lifeline and Helpline numbers
    -   Link to CU Boulder CAPS
    - Do additional research on what other apps have for an emergency feature
- Make LogIn.jsx a well-designed page (no more ugly sign in button)
- Position sign-out and display name better on Main Menu
- Any bug fixes and feedback implementations during my experience with ap

Although due to the app being far in the development process (hence there are some things that are difficult to change) plus time constraints, after some adjustments:
- repositioned the back-button, but it's not at a fixed position
- Added descriptions to certain parts of Fear and Step Info, rather than doing a pop-up tutorial
- Alignment of fears and steps are different but similar to what it looks like to the Figma prototype

...this project is now 100% complete. Everything I stated for my week 10 / spring break goals were accomplished. Not sure what the limits are for doing extra user-testing and feedback implementation, but I am feeling good on what I have right now.

I learned that creating web apps (especially when connecting it to a database) is very, very tedious. But I am glad on what I have learned, and I can't wait to work on more web projects!

The app is deployed here: https://limit-break.vercel.app/

## Week 11 Goals
These are the goals to complete by next week:
- Add a 'Remove Fear' option to 'Conquer Your Fears' and 'Fears Conquered' page.
- Do some ideation on what your documentation/promo website for Limit Break will be. Use AI.
- Think of quick walkthrough of app for video
    - This can include a story with a more serious fear with step(s) being entered, followed by entering a comedic fear as well.

As a note, after talking with Annie, you can show this at Expo with a video loop that shows the process and experience of app. If a user wants to, you can allow them to use the app as well (REALLYYYYY disclose that you can see the data they enter, so they should just play around with the app).

## Week 11 Progress

These were the goals to complete by this week:
- Add a 'Remove Fear' option to 'Conquer Your Fears' and 'Fears Conquered' page.
- Do some ideation on what your documentation/promo website for Limit Break will be. Use AI.
- Think of quick walkthrough of app for video
    - This can include a story with a more serious fear with step(s) being entered, followed by entering a comedic fear as well.

This is what I got done:
- I now have a 'Remove Fear' button when you click on a fear. I thought about adding the feature to 'Fears Conquered', but implementing it with the way my code is structured is pretty tricky. Plus, now that I thought about it, it wouldn't be necessary to add that page b/c it's supposed to be a track record of all the fears someone has conquered.
- I tried AI to do my website, but I REALLY do not want to use the styling it uses. I'll just make a basic website that has similar styling to my capstone project.
- I will have a rough storyboard completed before Capstone this week.
